For each project, we carry out a stringent due diligence process and careful analysis of valuation undertaken on a consistent basis which must be in line with the LIN Investment Strategy that reduces downside risk and enhances both parties’ returns on investments.<br><br>

            <p class="nB">
                LIN Private Equity Funds focus primarily on control-oriented investments in cash flow generating and asset-based businesses.<br><br>
                LIN invests in entities through three fund categories;<br><br>
                <b class="text-info">Acquisitions and Mergers Fund</b><br><br>
                LIN has allocated 10% of its direct investment funds portfolio to buyout mature profitable businesses with total existing enterprise values typically ranging from US$10 million to $1 Billion+, where management has developed a compelling plan to create substantial growth over the expected typical 5-7 year cycle of our investment and strong internal rate of return (IRRs).<br><br>
                LIN also participates in strategic mergers so as to consolidate industry positions in certain markets, for example through direct approach or if requested by relevant regulators/Governments where we have invested in related infrastructure projects.<br><br>
                <b class="text-info">Growth Equity and Venture Capital Fund</b><br><br>
                LIN has allocated 3% of its direct investment funds portfolio to Growth Equity and Venture Capital opportunities. These carry greater risk and we target higher returns. These less mature companies must show a strong growth trajectory based on a new technology or disruptive business model and must be led by an experienced management team.<br><br>
                <b class="text-info">Research and Innovation Fund</b><br><br>
                LIN has allocated 2% of its direct investment funds to research and innovation initiatives that is geared towards improving the competitive edge of investee projects and concerns.<br><br>
                This is done through direct investments and calling for research and innovation competitions in different fields that LIN has invested in. This Fund is also used to assist Governments that LIN has at least invested in the past to conduct feasibility study reports on viable business concepts presented by such Governments or companies.
