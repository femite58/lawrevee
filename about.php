		He is a savvy business man and a prodigious importer of Aluminium profiles and accessories, furniture fittings, building materials and topnotch security doors from Turkey, China, Italy and other countries who left this formidable empire to become a real estate juggernaut. His transition to the real estate industry was informed by his vision and its attendant burning desire to help average Nigerians and the most unlikely people to become home owners in Lagos and across other vibrant states.<br><br>
Tending towards perfectionism, and in his bid to curb the existing unprecedented fraudulent schemes prevalent in the real estate sector and also checkmate the arbitrarily hike of lands price in Lagos by the industry’s cabals, he started with the most fundamental aspect of real estate - LAND SURVEYING and for over 20 years and counting.<br><br>
It turned out that was the most sagacious decision he has ever made in his long years of business life as this single step has stood his subscribers in good stead offering them unencumbered possession to their properties and 101% security. He has over the long haul helped communities to secure title documents to their excised expanse and secure claim to their ownership through the process of land surveying and other practices that follows and as a result has legally acquired one of the largest land asset in Lagos and across other states. 
He is now poised to provide affordable lands and homes at strategic locations with huge investment potentials to both newbies and experienced real estate investors. For him, there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.
